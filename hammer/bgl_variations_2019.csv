#= Table of N=2 a_n coefficients without rounding.  The order is slightly modified from
#= the text. The order of processes is Bc->J/Psi, Bc->eta_c, B->D*, B->D, Bs->Ds*,  
#= Bs->Ds, Lambda_b->Lambda_c.  Within each, the ordering of form factors is g,f,F1,
#= F2 for the vectors; f0, f+ for the pseudoscalar decays; Hv,F1,F0,Ha,G1,G0 for the baryons
